# DXVK native Windows UMD

## Goal
Embed DXVK translation in a real VIOGPU D3D9/10/11 UMD, loaded by the Windows
runtime, with correct hardware rendering and full Display+Render integration.
ARM64, x64 and x86 are required; an app-local runtime is not the target.

## Next Step
60003 paired7051011/eb27a08 CI34592189757 allPASS, signed artifact10260421279.
Upload/copy fix1f4595d CI34594094209 allPASS. Native allocation/windowed
Present and constant-buffer childb40ccb1 CI34595019708 still building.
Continue SRV/sampler DDIs and paired60004 with actual allocation-ABI check;
main explicitly asks not to stop at CPU OpenAdapter harness.

## Phases
- [complete] Implement internal exact-LUID DXVK backend factory (runtime proof pending).
- [in_progress] Implement native DDI resource/shader/draw/readback coverage.
- [in_progress] Build and validate with personal-fork GitHub CI on supported architectures.
- [pending] Coordinate real-device offscreen runtime proof with main.
- [pending] Complete sharing, synchronization, presentation and full native acceptance.

## Constraints
Own only this independent checkout. No remote access until main grants a test
window. Preserve existing driver and desktop. Parent owns all shared worktree
and main-plan edits. This thread pins PWF_PLAN_ROOT to this directory.

## Errors
- b40ccb1 CI34595019708 passed217native allocation/present callback tests and
  compiled the production UMD, then caught const input arrays incompatible
  with WDK's mutable pSysMem. Made probe arrays mutable and moved production
  DDI/probe object compilation before the expensive backend build.
- New paired allocation ABI checker initially resolved shared/ at repository
  root instead of viogpu/. Corrected the parent path; temporary test outputs
  were automatically removed by TemporaryDirectory.
- Native allocation CI34594671352 compiled implementation but its fixture
  used DoNotWait, absent from D3DDDICB_LOCKFLAGS. Confirm exact SDK spelling
  before correcting the test. Upload/copy fix1f4595d CI34594094209 allPASS.
- Constant-buffer patch had a documentation-context typo; the atomic patch
  applied no files. Corrected the exact documentation line before reapplying.
- Upload/copy828b535 CI34593487334 found WDK D3D10_DDI_BOX uses signed LONG,
  while D3D11_BOX uses UINT. Reject negative coordinates before explicit
  conversion; no potentially wrapped signed box can reach the backend.
- Initial patch context for src/meson.build mismatched; no partial edits were
  applied. Corrected the context and applied successfully.
- Two guessed filenames were absent; used rg results to locate actual files.
- CI34585824018 failed: x64 MSVC target used invalid x64_x64 alias; x86/ARM64
  backend library compiled, but probe omitted dxbc-spirv include dependency.
  Fixed both before the next run. Identity sanitizer test passed69 cases.
- Submodule add with --depth=1 did not fetch its nondefault branch. Explicit
  depth1 branch fetch/checkout recovered it; completed .gitmodules separately.
- Shader container integrity regression found pinned dxbc-spirv buildContainer
  emits regular MD5 while validateHash requires the DXBC variant. The bridge
  now recomputes with the existing DXBC hash function without submodule edits.
- Unknown opcodes are accepted with empty layouts by the upstream parser;
  the SM4 bridge now validates opcodes, lengths and exact reconstructed tokens.
- Parent general clang-format workflow34586690304 failed on inherited source
  style; this integration changes no parent C/C++ implementation files.
- Parent34586690632: KMD compiled, but initial MSBuild Inf2Cat failed because
  three DXVK files were staged only later in the workflow. Added them to
  FilesToPackage in the independent vcxproj; no KMD source changes.
- a52df2b CI34587997416 compiled all3architectures; Windows CPU checks rejected
  re-encoded real shader tokens at check43. b76de1d preserves tokens verbatim;
  fast Windows D3DCompile/container/D3DReflect CI34588836455 shader-cpuPASS.
- Superseded child7a373289 CI34588590093 and parentc025e63 CI34588644705 were
  cancelled after replacement runs started, because they retain the already
  diagnosed real-shader reconstruction failure. Not an observation timeout.
- Producer header was initially resolved relative to checkout root; rg showed
  its actual location isviogpu/shared/viogpu_adapter_identity.h. Read-only
  review completed at the correct path; no producer files modified.
- Parent total contract checker retained baseline epoch-version and two-file
  package rules, incompatible with this branch's existing explicit60003 and
  five-file package. Narrow checker integration validates exact reserved
  source version and exact five files; full contract nowPASS. Check-only
  follow-up does not change7051011 binaries and avoids duplicate full CI.
